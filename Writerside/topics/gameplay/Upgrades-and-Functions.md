# Upgrades and Functions
_Upgrades people, upgrades!_

As of 2.0, not all features are immediately available to the player. They must be unlocked through the Upgrades Tree found in the corridor hub.

## Unlocking Upgrades
Upgrades can be unlocked by spending points earned by gaining TARDIS XP. TARDIS XP can be gained by completing a flight, with the distance travelled influencing how much you earned.

For every 100XP, you will gain 1 Upgrade point which can be saved to unlock features.
