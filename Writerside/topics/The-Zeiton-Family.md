# The Zeiton Family

In Doctor Who, Zeiton has been stated to be the base material used to construct the TARDIS. Now you can find it in Minecraft!


## Zeiton Ore
Zeiton Ore spawns in the overworld, acting similar to Iron Ore in the spawn rate and functionality.

Similar to Iron Ore, destroying Zeiton Ore with an Iron Pickaxe will drop Raw Zeiton which can be smelted to make ingots used for crafting.

## Zeiton Fused Blocks
Inspired by Create, Zeiton can be infused with Iron and Copper blocks to create fused variants. This can be done in the crafting table or by interacting with the material block with a Zeiton ingot in your hand.
