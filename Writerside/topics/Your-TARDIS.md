# Inside the TARDIS

There are a few key areas you'll be interacting with whilst playing TARDIS Refined.

## The Desktop
The main control room, the default and interchangeable room that usually houses the TARDIS console unit.

## The Corridor Hub
The corridor hub is the connection between the Desktop, the Eye of Harmony Chamber, the ARS Upgrades Room and the outer corridors.

## The ARS Upgrades Room
An unbreakable room which houses the TARDIS's core life, the ARS tree. Here you can spend TARDIS XP to unlock TARDIS abilities.

## The Eye of Harmony Chamber
This chamber holds the Eye of Harmony gateway and is the heart of the TARDIS's power.

## The Outer Corridors
An infinite maze of rooms and corridors.

### Rooms
Rooms can be found within the outer corridors, generated randomly and empty so that the player can fill them!

### Gravity Shaft Chambers
Gravity shaft chambers are generated every 390ish blocks, allowing the player to ascend (or descend) between the two floors of corridors.

These rooms also feature teleporters, which will take you back to the corridor hub should you get lost.
