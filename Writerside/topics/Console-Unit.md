# Console Unit

The console unit is the most important block in the mod, used to control tge majority of the TARDIS's functions. The block comes in different styles and skins which can be selected with the Console Configurator block.

There is only ever allowed one main console unit, but the player may place as many as they wish. A console will become the main driving console when it is interacted with. You can tell if a console unit is the main unit by if it is emitting light.
