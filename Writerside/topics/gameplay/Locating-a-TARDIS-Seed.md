# Creating a TARDIS
## Acquiring a Root Plant

Millions of years ago, the tectonic plates under the over-world shifted allowing for unknown entities to bleed through into the environment. Now, small clusters can be found deep underground with small TARDIS roots ready to be grown.

Root plants can be found in small pockets underground in the Minecraft Overworld.

The plant pockets can be found between <b>y=-50 and y=20</b>.

These pockets can only be found under **mountains** and **ocean** biomes. Roots are considered to be rare, and may require a larger chunk of time to find.

## Growing a Root Plant
Root Plants cannot be grown independently; they require a source of heat from a magma block to grow. Place the root on top of a magma block to start the growing process.

The time it takes to grow can vary, as it is designed to take a longer than most Minecraft plants. At the time of writing, it may take an average of 20-25 minutes for a root to fully mature. Results may vary.

> Creative Mode tip <br/><br/> The growth of a root is tied to randomTickSpeed. Increasing this number will quickly advance the seed's growth.

The TARDIS root grows in five stages with the fifth being a fully matured TARDIS plant. You may enter the TARDIS internal growth once the seed has reached the final stage.

We recommend spending this time to locate and collect the required items found for the next stage.

## Terraforming a Root Plant

In order to gain access to the TARDIS's internal dimensions, you will need to shear away the roots that cover the entrance.

Inside the TARDIS you will find the TARDIS root cave, a small area within itself which the TARDIS has grown for you to occupy.
You now have your own personal dimension and can now begin to terraform. In this state, the TARDIS has no machinery, means of configuration or flight. This space can act as a temporary personal base but is not intended to be a final solution.

To terraform a TARDIS, you will need to build a multi-block structure that consists of Copper blocks, a Redstone block and a Terraformer block, placed like so.

To activate the terraformer, interact with an Amethyst Screwdriver. 

You will know if the process has begun if the Terraformer has consumed the Copper and Redstone blocks. The process requires the root cave to be completely empty of players, so exit via the door to start the terraforming process.

Terraforming, as well as any Desktop configuration takes 60 seconds to complete. During this time you cannot enter or operate the TARDIS. Once the process has complete, you will be presented with the proto-desktop.

## The next steps
Congratulations! You've made yourself a proto-TARDIS.

Once the terraforming process has been completed, the proto-desktop, corridors, ARS room and the Eye of Harmony will become available to you. From here you might be interested in the next stages.
