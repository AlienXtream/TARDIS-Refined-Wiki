# The Landing Pad

The landing pad acts as a summoner for any TARDIS **with the Landing Pad upgrade**.
Interact with a bound TARDIS key to call the TARDIS. 

There are certain conditions in which a TARDIS ***will not*** come.
: * When the TARDIS does not have the landing pad upgrade unlocked.
* When the Handbrake is engaged
* When the TARDIS is taking off / landing
* When the TARDIS does not have enough fuel
