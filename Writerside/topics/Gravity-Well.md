# Gravity Well

The Gravity Well appears naturally within the TARDIS, generating within the Gravity Well Chambers.

This block allows the player to ascend/descend without the risk of fall damage.

Interacting with the block with an Amethyst Screwdriver will cycle through the gravity radius.

This block CANNOT be used outside of a TARDIS.
