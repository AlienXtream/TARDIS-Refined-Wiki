Welcome to TARDIS Refined, a Doctor Who mod that aims to expand and adapt the TARDIS into the Minecraft experience.

# The Basic Steps
In order to get yourself on board the TARDIS as quickly as possible, you will have to complete the following steps.

1. Create your Screwdriver and first Astral Manipulator
2. Locate a TARDIS Root plant
3. Grow the root into the basic shell
4. Terraform the basic shell into a hollowed TARDIS
5. Power the TARDIS and craft its requirements

Steps 1 and 2 are optional for Creative Mode players, but the player will still need to terraform and supply power in order for a TARDIS to be used.
