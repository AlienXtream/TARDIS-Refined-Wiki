# Astral Manipulator Crafting

## What is the Astral Manipulator?
The Astral Manipulator is an in-world crafting block that allows the player to project a selection of blocks to be converted into a new item. It is the only way to craft TARDIS devices.

## Interfacing with the Astral Manipulator
All interactions between the Astral Manipulator and the player must be done through the Amethyst Screwdriver multi-tool. A player may crouch interact with the multi-tool in hand at any point to cancel their selection.

| Right Click with Amethyst Screwdriver, no selection   | Begins the selection projection. Interacting with a block whilst the screwdriver is in hand will place a point. |
| Right Click with Amethyst Screwdriver, with selection | Confirms the selection and will create the recipe's result, so long as it is valid.                             |
| Right Click (empty hand)                              | Resets the projection if it is currently active.                                                                |
