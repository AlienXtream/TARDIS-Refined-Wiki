# Immersive Portals

We understand our players like the feature of being able to view the outside of the TARDIS from the inside, and the inside of the TARDIS from the outside
With some additional help from [The Judge](https://github.com/thejudge156) we implemented support for Immersive Portals

### Notes
This compatibility is only present on Fabric versions of the Mod, in theory it would work for Forge in a limited capacity for the 1.20.1 version of the mod, but we have disabled this by default with no way for a player to turn it on. We feel there isn't a demand for the Forge version and the Forge Version of Immersive Portals isn't entirely official, making development rather delayed at times
