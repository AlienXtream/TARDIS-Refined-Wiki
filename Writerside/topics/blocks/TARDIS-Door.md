# TARDIS Door

The TARDIS door is a craftable block that can be placed anywhere in the TARDIS interior dimension. The selected shell will be reflected in the door's shape. A TARDIS interior can only ever have one active door, which is determined by what door was last used to leave the ship. However, they can still be placed and used for secondary console room builds.

Crouch interacting with the door will toggle the lock. Useful for keeping things out!
