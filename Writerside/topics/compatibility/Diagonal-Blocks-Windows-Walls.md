# Diagonal Blocks (Windows, Walls)

When developing the mod in 1.19.2, we had some users baffled as to why their Astral Manipulator recipes weren't crafting even though they had the exact blocks they needed...
When investigating, we found that when Tardis Refined was installed with any of ny of the Diagonal X mods, it would replace the Vanilla block and cause crafting problems!

After some communication of the Developer of that mod, we were advised of a fix which was implemented for [Diagonal Walls](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/diagonal-walls) and [Diagonal Windows](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/diagonal-windows)

You can now craft without any interruptions!
