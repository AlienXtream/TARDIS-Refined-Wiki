# The Eye of Harmony (&amp; Power)

![eohc.png](eohc.png)

## Isn't opening the eye a bad thing?
There are conflicting accounts of the Eye of Harmony within the Doctor Who continuity. Therefor we have taken it upon ourselves to invent our own interpretation.

## What is the Eye of Harmony in TARDIS Refined?
The Eye of Harmony (EOH) is the source of the TARDIS's power and must be activiated in order to initialise the ship's systems.

## Where do I find the Eye of Harmony?
The Eye of Harmony chamber can be found under the corridor hub, down the gravity shaft.

## Alright enough of this. How do I open the Eye?

Alright, pushy. The Eye of Harmony's container has to be initialised by installing and activating four Arton Pillars in the Artron Pillar slots which can be found around the Chamber.

See Astral Manipulator crafting recipes for how to do this!

_As of writing this Wiki, we don't have a better pillar model. Hopefully that will be sorted soon! - River_

Once the Eye's door has opened, the TARDIS will now be capable of in-taking power.

## Refueling the TARDIS
Now the TARDIS is capable of power, you may begin fueling by toggling the refuel button. This allows the TARDIS to take in fuel from the surrounding environment over a perioid of time.

Taking off will automatically disable the refueling process.
